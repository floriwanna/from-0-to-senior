# About
This is to know how to describe or learn the "good practices" of writing code. There is a famous book, with the same name of the file, that supposedly describe the rules of this. But I belive the real rule is to write code that is understandable for another person. 

If you read that book, please don't take it literally and use it as a tool that could help you as an 'Tips of good coding', not as a bible. 
Let's continue with this :)


## Stay native
This mean not to write embebed code like writting HTML text injected in a scrypt or sql queries in the Backend code
Advantages:
- code colored
- Syntax checked
- Separation of concerns
- Reusable
- Avoids string parsings
